The Adversary Lab provides a complete security monitoring environment that includes:

- **Windows Virtual Machine** with Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) and Sysmon
- **Microsoft Sentinel** SIEM/SOAR platform
- **Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized logging
- **Data Collection Rules** for VM monitoring
- **Azure Activity Logs** Deployed for monitoring tenant management activity
- **Network Security Groups** with controlled access
- **Stratus Red Team** for cloud attack simulation and detection testing
- **Atomic Red Team** for MITRE ATT&CK technique testing
- **Sysmon** for advanced Windows event logging

## Architecture

The lab deploys across three Azure scopes both manual and programatically:

1. **Resource Group Level**: Core infrastructure (VM, networking, Log Analytics, Sentinel)
2. **Subscription Level**: Azure Activity logs and security monitoring
3. **Tenant Level**: Entra ID audit and sign-in logs (manual configuration required)

<br>

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **PowerShell 7 or later** - [Download here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
- **Azure PowerShell Module (Az)** - Install with: `Install-Module -Name Az`

### Azure Requirements
- Azure subscription with **Contributor** permissions
- Ability to create resources at both **Resource Group** and **Subscription** levels
- Valid email address for notifications (optional)

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> This lab can be deployed with the initially provisioned GA but it is recommended to create a user with the permissions above. Use the script in the scripts section of the repo to create the user.

<br>

> [!NOTE]  
> In a production enviroment you would create a service principal or managed identity that would run a CI/CD pipeline. This is done this way to make the lab more accessible. 

<br>

### Network Requirements
- Public IP address for RDP access (auto-detected if not specified)
- Outbound internet connectivity for VM updates and monitoring

<br>

## 🚀 Quick Start 

### 1. Clone or Download Files
Ensure all Bicep templates and PowerShell script are in the same directory:
```
azure-logging-lab/
├── adversary_lab_deploy.ps1
├── main.bicep
├── main_subscription.bicep
└── modules/
    ├── log_analytics.bicep
    ├── networking.bicep
    ├── sentinel_deployment.bicep
    ├── vm_ama.bicep
    └── vm_data_collection.bicep
```

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> This lab creates real Azure resources that incur costs. Always ensure to monitor your budget to keep costs under control. When in doubt use the Azure Cost Calculator https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?msockid=2777256a672e6067007a30ef66326112

<br>

### 2. Basic Deployment
```powershell
.\adversary_lab_deploy.ps1
```
<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you get an error "The file C:\adversary_lab_deploy.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170." you can bypass it temporarily with the following command: pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\adversary_lab_deploy.ps1

<br>

### 3. Advanced Deployment (Command Line)
```powershell
.\adversary_lab_deploy.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroupName "rg-security-lab" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" `
    -AdminUsername "secadmin" `
    -VmSize "Standard_D4s_v3" `
    -NotificationEmail "admin@company.com"
```

<br>

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Manual Entra ID Configuration
Due to elevated permissions required, configure Entra ID logs manually:

1. Navigate to **Azure Portal** → **Microsoft Entra ID** → **Diagnostic settings**
2. Click **Add diagnostic setting**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `EntraID-AuditLogs`
   - **Logs**: Check `AuditLogs` and `SignInLogs`
   - **Destination**: Send to Log Analytics workspace
   - **Workspace**: Select your deployed workspace


### 2. Connect to VM
Use the provided RDP command:
```bash
mstsc /v:<VM_PUBLIC_IP>
```

### 3. Install Sysmon, Atomic, and Stratus Red Team

<br>

```powershell
# Deploy Sysmon
./deploy_sysmon.ps1
```
<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Sysmon script may error out. Try running it again to see if there is a consistent error. 

<br>

```powershell
# Deploy Stratus Red Team
./deploy_stratus_red_team.ps1
```
<br>

```powershell
# Deploy Atomic Red Team
./deploy_atomic_red_team.ps1
```
<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The script will prompt you to install Nuget (.Net Package Manager) which is needed for some tests. Ensure to install what is required. 


<br>

### 4. Verify Data Collection
Wait 10-15 minutes, then check:
- Check the Log Analytics Workspace has data within the AzureActivity and Event Tables. Sample KQL provided below.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Azure Activity Logs can be provisioned instantly or take up to an an hour to initial provision. It is dependent on the load of the service at the time of the request. 

<br>

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Attack Simulation Scenarios
The lab supports various security testing scenarios:

1. **Credential Attacks**: Test password spraying, brute force
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Simulate local privilege escalation
3. **Lateral Movement**: Network discovery and movement simulation
4. **Data Exfiltration**: File transfer and data staging
5. **Persistence**: Registry modifications, scheduled tasks

### KQL Query Examples
Monitor activities with these sample queries:

```kql
// Recent Azure Activity (Management) Events
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(2h)
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, OperationNameValue

// PowerShell Logs
Event
| where Source == "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)

// Sysmon Logs
Event
| where Source == "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
```
<br>

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure you have Contributor role on the subscription
- Try refreshing Azure credentials: `Connect-AzAccount -Force`
- Check if you can create resources in the specified region

**Deployment Failures**
- Verify all Bicep files are present and not corrupted
- Check Azure service availability in your region
- Ensure VM size is available in the selected location

**Network Connectivity**
- Verify your public IP is correctly detected
- Check NSG rules allow RDP from your IP
- Confirm VM has started successfully

**Data Collection Issues**
- Wait 15-30 minutes for initial data flow
- Verify Azure Monitor Agent is installed and running
- Check Data Collection Rule associations



## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Automatic Cost Controls
- **VM Auto-shutdown**: Default 11:30 PM daily
- **Budget Alerts**: $50/month with email notifications
- **Premium Storage**: Balanced performance and cost

### Manual Cost Savings
- Stop VM when not in use
- Reduce Log Analytics retention if not needed
- Delete resources when lab testing is complete

### Cost Estimation
<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> These are estimates and its best to use the Azure Cost Calculator for accurate up to date pricing. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?msockid=2777256a672e6067007a30ef66326112

<br>

Typical monthly costs (East US region):
- **Standard_D2s_v3 VM**: ~$70/month (if running 24/7)
- **With auto-shutdown**: ~$30-40/month
- **Log Analytics**: ~$5-15/month (depending on data volume)
- **Total estimated**: ~$35-55/month with auto-shutdown

<br>

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Network Security
- RDP access restricted to your public IP only
- NSG rules follow principle of least privilege
- No public access to Log Analytics workspace

### VM Security
- Windows 11 with latest security updates
- Azure Monitor Agent for comprehensive logging
- Boot diagnostics enabled for troubleshooting

### Data Protection
- All logs encrypted at rest and in transit
- Configurable retention periods
- Azure RBAC for access control
